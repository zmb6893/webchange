  <h1>Zoe's Intro for GitHub</h1>
  </div>
  <p>Hello, my name is Zoe. I live in Henderson, Nevada and I recently graduated from Coronado High School. Some sports that I participated in during my time at Coronado were wrestling and track and field. In my free time, some of the things I enjoy are reading, drawing, learning, and hiking. I can't really think of anything else to say so I will be ending things here.</p>
  <p>I think that my favorite food right now is green curry:</p>
