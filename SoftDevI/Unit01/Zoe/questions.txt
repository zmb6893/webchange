Zoe Bingham

8. Adding the directory using "git add Zoe" resulted in no changes when typing in "git status", so no new commit was necessary. I did "git commit -m "added Zoe directory" anyway, which resulted in "no changes added to commit". I pushed even though nothing would result from the push "git push origin master". No new commits appeared on GitHub.
